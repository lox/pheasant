Pheasant
========

Pheasant is an object relational mapper written to take advantage of PHP 5.3. Simple relationships
are supported, with the emphasis being on scalability and performance over complexity.

Pheasant doesn't attempt to abstract the database and makes heavy use of
MySQL/Innodb features.
